All patches are fixed upstream except:

 * **ogroups_2.patch**: wrong filter
 * **grouptabs2.patch**: index error
 * **groupusername.patch**: correct users display in groups


As we stick to a release version, we apply on the go the patches we need to the debian packages that we mirror from fusiondirectory (as they early remove them, we do not have the same release cycles).
